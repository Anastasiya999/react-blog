## :pencil: About The Project

The development of this project was driven by the motivation to learn how to create and implement full stack applications. During the implementation, I was referring to the MVC pattern. I have practiced writing REST API calls, debugging them using Insomnia program. In addition, I learned to create models using Moongose, controllers, provide JWT authentication and validation with express-validator. I have also become familiar with the use of local storage by storing the user token.
For front-end part I have used Material UI components as well as CSS-Modules / SCSS.
